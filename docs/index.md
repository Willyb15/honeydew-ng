# Honeydew

Honeydew is a feature-based browser automation suite based on the
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org) project. It accepts as input a
feature file written in structured English and parses that file for
instructions for actions to perform on a browser. Honeydew can drive
browsers wherever there is a Selenium Webdriver jar running: your
desktop, someone else's desktop, and SauceLabs are all potential
candidates for this.
