#### How do I create new folders ?

When choosing a filename, just put in the path you want; any folders
that do not exist along the path will be created for you.

<video controls="controls" width="100%">
  <source type="video/webm" src="new-feature.webm"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
</video>

#### How do I create new sets ?

Add `Set: @something` to the preamble of your feature, and then click
on the link it creates.

<video controls="controls" width="100%">
  <source type="video/webm" src="new-set.webm"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the video element.</p>
  </video>

#### How can I find out if a JIRA ticket has automation?

Excellent question, dear reader! We have a Chrome extension that does
precisely that: when you're viewing a JIRA ticket, it will query
Honeydew to see if any scripts have cited that JIRA ticket. Check out
the [extension in the Chrome web store][ext]!
